        Wow, I get a lot done when I'm not sitting around playing video games.
        <br><br>
        The amount of things I got done during the past week and this week!
        <a href="music/snayk.ogg">New soundtrack added by SneakySnake
        himself</a>, sounds and fonts can be included in resource packages,
        servers can take in resource packages (can't do anything with them
        though...), playing sounds, beginning of chat... and other small things
        that only developers would care about.
        <br>
        I'm surprised after 8 months I'm still working on this.
        And right now I'm working on chat! Woo! That multiplayer experience is
        on it's way. Soon you'll be able to talk about how beautiful (or ugly)
        the map you're playing looks. Those golden flowers look stunning!<br>

        Here's a demo of playing sounds and music together:

        Woo, Easter Holidays! So I wanted to focus on art, sounds and music for
        a bit. Here's some drawings of the main weapon in the game:
        <img src="imgs/concept_art_zord.png"><br>
        I do like the idea of the weapon you wield getting bloodier in battles.
        Music? I'm working on "Casual".
        Sounds? rodrun and his <em>brilliant</em>
        <a href="sounds/belgianwaffles.wav">voice acting</a> will surely
        grace Zordzman and capture the hearts of many players in the future.<br>

        So there's good news, and not-so-good news.<br>
        The not-so-good news is that Hollinski and SneakySnake no longer work on
        Zordzman, possibly because the project has grown large and a few
        arguments and not-so-pleasant experiences were had.
        They might help with a few things occasionally, but that will be about
        it. So sad!<br><br>
        The good news is that Resource Management is almost done. It is a
        complete rework of how resources are managed and this means something
        for the players and people running servers. Servers can have custom
        resources sent to the client in the form of "resource packages" that can
        easily be made.<br><br>
        Microcode (or rodrun, as we <em>affectionally</em> call him) will
        probably be helping along with Zordzman in the future.<br><br>
        Check out the concept art of Taming Rods and.. Electrikes? Electric?
        Elect rodrun for president 2016? Anyways,
        <a href="https://github.com/TeamLe-Shop/zordzman-plus-plus/issues/39">
        here you go!</a><br><br>
        After tomorrow will be the start of my 2 week long Easter Holidays!
        It's quite interesting how these posts started at Halloween, talking
        about how I hoped Zordzman Multiplayer would be "ready for all" by
        Christmas. Christmas and New Year have passed, and it's 3 months into
        2015! We're making good progress anyways.<br>

        Oh, I just realized it's March now. That "March" track I was talking
        about 2 posts ago?
        <a href="music/March-3.ogg">Here it is!</a><br>
        It happens to be the longest track I've made! 30 seconds. (wow)<br>
        Apart from that, nothing has happened since the last post.<br>
        Configuration files such has JSON huds have been moved to
        <code>config/</code>. You can now sort of select what server you want
        to connect to by changing <code>config/config.json</code>.<br>
        Have fun!<br>

        Nope, still haven't given up. Okay, so entities client side are about
        done. Sneaky has also fixed the failing CI builds.<br>
        This is the stage where I want to start making real content for
        Zordzman. Art, music, sounds, gameplay...<br>
        On Mac, Zordzman still works very well with Steam.
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400180596">
        Screenshots</a>,
        Steam overlay, all of that. Of course, it's not official, so you can't
        join each other's games or anything like that.<br>
        If you're bored, here's a cool poster that promotes violence,
        Japanese weapons, and safe programming languages with borrow checkers.<br>

        <img src="imgs/rustykatana.png"><br>
        Slice those bastards up with your new <strong>RUSTY KATANA</strong>,
        which <strong>HURTS!</strong><br>
        Not only is it lightweight<strong>*</strong> and easy to swing,
        but it's <strong>SAFE</strong> too!<br><br>
        The built in <strong>BORROW CHECKER</strong> will prevent you from heartbleed when you
        try to <strong>STAB YOURSELF FIERCELY TO DEATH</strong> in battle<strong>**</strong>!<br><br>

        *Heavier than most katanas due to rust.<br>
        **You will probably still die of goto fail.<br>

        Exciting shit!<br>
        - New zorroman track, "March". There's also a failed one (but hey,
          it's still a track amirite?) "Early Morning Competition".<br>
        - KTB and cyanboy have boarded the TeamLe-Shop ship.<br>
        - KTB shall be maintaining this wiki.<br>
        - SneakySnake still works on zordzman, and because of his and
          Hollinski's efforts it builds on Windows!<br>
        - There is now a zordzman-plus-plus wiki (development-oriented)<br>
          being written by Hollinski.<br><br>

        I'm still trying to keep the development strong.<br><br>

      <div class="news_rectangle">
        Thought I'd given up yet? Nope!<br>
        So Hollinski's
        <code><a href="https://github.com/Holiverh/zordzman-plus-plus/tree/entity">entity</code></a>
        and <code><a href="https://github.com/Holiverh/zordzman-plus-plus/tree/message-processor">message-processor</a></code> branches
        on his repo have been merged with the main one, and they are quite a nice
        contribution.<br>
        Right now I'm just working on killing the old <code>TCPSocket</code> from the
        client and using <code>MessageProcessor</code> instead.
        It's almost Christmas, and I'm on holidays, so I can work on this in peace.
        At this rate we probably wont get it done for Christmas, so probably by late January/early February.<br><br>

        Music is being composed for Zordzman! There's currently 3 tracks (all very short):
        <a href="https://github.com/TeamLe-Shop/zordzman-plus-plus/blob/master/resources/music/soundtrack/dunno.ogg">dunno</a>,
	<a href="https://github.com/TeamLe-Shop/zordzman-plus-plus/blob/master/resources/music/soundtrack/Lively.ogg">Lively</a>,
        and <a href="zordzman/music/Ready.ogg">Ready</a>, all created in that order.<br>
        Ready is the one I created just today. The beat in that track I've done many times
        in real life using a table, my hand and a pen, so it was made pretty fast compared
        to the other two.
        Ready's beat (not the tune) sounds a bit like Space Jam to me.<br><br>

        Whew. Finally replaced all SDLNet code.<br>
        If you didn't catch that, we're not using SDLNet anymore.
        It's full of shit.<br>
        We're using system sockets (BSD for Mac and Linux),
        and possibly WinSock for Winjizzle.
        <br>
        Zordzman will be available as an Application Package in Mac!
        This means if you're a Mac gamer you can add it to your Steam Library. Have fun!<br><br>

        <b>Happy 500 commits Zordzman!</b>
		Seriously, we just reached 500 commits yesterday.<br>
        We then looked at the past commits and found something interesting.<br>
        Over 20% of Zordzman's commits were done in 4 days.<br>
        <b>4 days.</b><br>
        It was a fast and lively start, and it seems to be dying off...
        but I wont give up.<br>

        I reached 4 days uptime yesterday, but my

        I have to start making some more progress for Zordzman++. Multiplayer is a confusing mess,
        and right now I'm only working on the server loading a map and having the client and server
        decide what to do if the client doesn't have the map or the client has a modified map.<br><br>

        I'm supposed to be celebrating Hallowe'en or whatever, but I won't get a lot
        done before it, so I'll put on a Christmas theme and hope Zordzman Multiplayer is
        ready for all by then.<br><br>
