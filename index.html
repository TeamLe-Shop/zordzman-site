        Exciting shit!<br>
        - New zorroman track, "March". There's also a failed one (but hey,
          it's still a track amirite?) "Early Morning Competition".<br>
        - KTB and cyanboy have boarded the TeamLe-Shop ship.<br>
        - KTB shall be maintaining this wiki.<br>
        - SneakySnake still works on zordzman, and because of his and
          Hollinski's efforts it builds on Windows!<br>
        - There is now a zordzman-plus-plus wiki (development-oriented)<br>
          being written by Hollinski.<br>

        I'm still trying to keep the development strong.<br>

        Thought I'd given up yet? Nope!<br>
        So Hollinski's
        <code><a href="https://github.com/Holiverh/zordzman-plus-plus/tree/entity">entity</code></a>
        and <code><a href="https://github.com/Holiverh/zordzman-plus-plus/tree/message-processor">message-processor</a></code> branches
        on his repo have been merged with the main one, and they are quite a nice
        contribution.<br>
        Right now I'm just working on killing the old <code>TCPSocket</code> from the
        client and using <code>MessageProcessor</code> instead.
        It's almost Christmas, and I'm on holidays, so I can work on this in peace.
        At this rate we probably wont get it done for Christmas, so probably by late January/early February.<br><br>

        Music is being composed for Zordzman! There's currently 3 tracks (all very short):
        <a href="zordzman/music/dunno.ogg">dunno</a>, <a href="zordzman/music/Lively.ogg">Lively</a>,
        and <a href="zordzman/music/Ready.ogg">Ready</a>, all created in that order.<br>
        Ready is the one I created just today. The beat in that track I've done many times
        in real life using a table, my hand and a pen, so it was made pretty fast compared
        to the other two.
        Ready's beat (not the tune) sounds a bit like Space Jam to me.<br><br>

        Whew. Finally replaced all SDLNet code.<br>
        If you didn't catch that, we're not using SDLNet anymore.
        It's full of shit.<br>
        We're using system sockets (BSD for Mac and Linux),
        and possibly WinSock for Winjizzle.
        <br>
        Zordzman will be available as an Application Package in Mac!
        This means if you're a Mac gamer you can add it to your Steam Library. Have fun!<br><br>

        <b>Happy 500 commits Zordzman!</b>
		Seriously, we just reached 500 commits yesterday.<br>
        We then looked at the past commits and found something interesting.<br>
        Over 20% of Zordzman's commits were done in 4 days.<br>
        <b>4 days.</b><br>
        It was a fast and lively start, and it seems to be dying off...
        but I wont give up.<br>
		Here's what one of the contributers said:

          We just shit out a few commits every once in a while<br>
          Mostly you now<br>
          <a href="https://github.com/TeamLe-Shop/zordzman-plus-plus/pulse/monthly"></a><br>
          78 commits this month<br>
          = less than 3 commits per day on average<br>

        I reached 4 days uptime yesterday, but my
        brother had to turn my computer off because I ate fish.<br>...<br>
        I have to start making some more progress for Zordzman++. Multiplayer is a confusing mess,
        and right now I'm only working on the server loading a map and having the client and server
        decide what to do if the client doesn't have the map or the client has a modified map.<br><br>

        I'm supposed to be celebrating Hallowe'en or whatever, but I won't get a lot
        done before it, so I'll put on a Christmas theme and hope Zordzman Multiplayer is
        ready for all by then.<br><br>
